  NextSTEP is an object-oriented, multitasking operating system which was developed by NeXT Computer, Inc.

  I started working with NeXTSTEP in '92, which was strongly modelled MVC; and delegation over inheritance for that matter.

  NeXTstep was later modified to separate the underlying operating system from the higher-level object libraries.
  The result was the OpenStep API, a predecesor of Mac OS X and the Cocoa API.
