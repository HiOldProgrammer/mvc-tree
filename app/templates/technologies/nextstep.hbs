<p>
  NextSTEP is an object-oriented, multitasking operating system which was developed by NeXT Computer, Inc.
</p>

<p>
  It was strongly modelled after MVC; and delegation over inheritance for that matter.
</p>

<blockquote>
  Tim Berners Lee once commented that his pioneering World-Wide-Web application was only feasible at the time because of NeXTstep.

<p>
  NeXTstep was later modified to separate the underlying operating system from the higher-level object libraries.
  The result was the OpenStep API, a predecesor of Mac OS X and the Cocoa API.
